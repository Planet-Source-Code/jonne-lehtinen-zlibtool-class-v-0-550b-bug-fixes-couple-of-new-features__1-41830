## Zlibtool Class v\. 0\.550b \(bug fixes \+ couple of new features\)


</div>

### Description

I wrote the code for my friend to demonstrate how to pack several files in one file with zLib and extract them. There still might be some bugs even though I tried to test it properly. The code extracts all or nothing so there's still some deveploment to be done, but I think it works pretty well... There's a lot of comments so it should be pretty easy to use.

ZLibTool is required, Available in http://www.dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm

If packing lots of files/large files there must be enough space on destination drive and windows temp folder drive (NEW! you can now change the temp folder to use).

Also new: wildcard support.
